    The `<base>` tag below is present to support two advanced deployment options:
    1) Differential serving. 2) Serving from a non-root path.

    Instead of manually editing the `<base>` tag yourself, you should generally either:
    a) Add a `basePath` property to the build configuration in your `polymer.json`.
    b) Use the `--base-path` command-line option for `polymer build`.

    Note: If you intend to serve from a non-root path, see [polymer-root-path] below.

     * [polymer-root-path]

     * By default, we set `Polymer.rootPath` to the server root path (`/`).
     * Leave this line unchanged if you intend to serve your app from the root
     * path (e.g., with URLs like `my.domain/` and `my.domain/view1`).
     *
     * If you intend to serve your app from a non-root path (e.g., with URLs
     * like `my.domain/my-app/` and `my.domain/my-app/view1`), edit this line
     * to indicate the path from which you'll be serving, including leading
     * and trailing slashes (e.g., `/my-app/`).
